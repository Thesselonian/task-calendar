# Calendar App #

## By Eric Young ##

This app shows sections for each hour of the working day. The sections are color coded depending on whether or not they have already passed, belong to the current hour, or are in the future. Each block contains a text area section where the user can input tasks. There is an associated save button that will push the task to local storage. The task will then re-populate when the page is closed and re-opened. 

Here is a screenshot of the application:
